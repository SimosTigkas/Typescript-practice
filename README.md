# Typescript-practice
This repo will be focused in building blocks of TypeScript through a hands-on approach and exploring basic types, defining custom types, typing objects and arrays, optional properties, manual and implicit typing, literal types, unions and intersections, type narrowing, function return types, void and any utility types, and generics.
